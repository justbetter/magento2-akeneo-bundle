# Magento2 Akeneo Bundle

This Magento2 extension made by [JustBetter](https://justbetter.nl) extends the official [Akeneo Connector](https://github.com/akeneo/magento2-connector-community) with several features and optimizations.

These features can be enabled / disabled via an extra configuration section called `JustBetter Akeneo` that is added to the default Akeneo Connector Configuration in Magento.

## Installation
```
composer require justbetter/magento2-akeneo-bundle
bin/magento module:enable JustBetter_AkeneoBundle
bin/magento setup:upgrade && bin/magento cache:flush
```
## Configuration
- Enable and disable different Akeneo features. Go to `Stores > Configuration > Catalog > Akeneo Connector > JustBetter Akeneo`.
- To map specific Akeneo attribute code with a Magento Customer group. Simply go to `Stores > Configuration > Catalog > Akeneo Connector > Products > Customer Group Pricing`
- When you would like to use the Tax Class Mapping: map the Akeneo Attribute Option Codes to the Magento Tax Classes. Don't forget to define the Tax attribute within the Attribute configuration for this feature to work.

## Import finished events
We added a total of 5 events:
```
akeneo_connector_import_finish_category
akeneo_connector_import_finish_family
akeneo_connector_import_finish_attribute
akeneo_connector_import_finish_option
akeneo_connector_import_finish_product
```

These events are fired before the `cleanCache` function which only runs at the end of the job execution.
That way the cache will still be flushed after your hook.

*Please keep in mind that the Akeneo Products Import is executed per family ([since 102.1.1](https://github.com/akeneo/magento2-connector-community/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-10211-)). So if you import products from multiple families the `akeneo_connector_import_finish_product` event will be called multiple times.*

## Metric Units
When enabled the default metric unit for metric attributes will be added to the `unit` field in the `eav_attribute` table.
This can be overridden at a channel, currently we only support one channel for this which is configurable in the backend.

You can run this from the command line using `bin/magento metric:import`

It is also automatically run after the attribute import

## Family - Not Visible Individually
If you need to set the visibility of all products that belong to certain families to `Not Visible Individually` you can select those families.
After each import this will run and set products to not visible.

You can also run this from the command line using `bin/magento akeneo:setfamilynotvisible`
